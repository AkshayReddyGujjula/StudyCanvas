# pymupdf4llm is intentionally excluded here: PyMuPDF ships ~150 MB of native
# binaries which exceed Vercel's 249 MB Lambda limit.  Install it separately in
# your local venv if you want higher-quality Markdown extraction:
#   pip install pymupdf4llm
# pdf_service.py detects its presence at runtime and uses it automatically.
